    \ingroup tools

    This file allows to export functions and classes from this directory in a dynamic/shared lib and to append the
    correct __declspec() declaration on windows. If you want to export one, make sure you have set
    \code
    #include "lib_imexport.h"

    class LIB_EXPORT exportedClassName {
       ...
    };

    LIB_EXPORT void exportedFunctionName();
    \endcode

    Then when compiling define the preprocessor symbol \c LIB_IN_DLL when exporting AND using the classes/functions.
    When compiling the classes for export, also define the preprocessor symbol \c LIB_EXPORT_LIBRARY .
